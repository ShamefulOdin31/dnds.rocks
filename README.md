# dnds.rocks

This project was the final project for my PHP focused web development class. 

We were allowed to set out own topic for this project. My topic was DND. The application allows you to create a account, create characters and view spells in a list from a API. The end goal was to deploy the application to a hosting platform. I did host it on DigitalOcean on the dnds.rocks domain but am not longer paying for it.

The repo in its current state will not function as I do not have access to the database schema. May update in the future.
